# ML-EARLY-DIABETES-DETECTION
# 🩺 ML Early Diabetes Detection

This project uses **Machine Learning** to detect the likelihood of early diabetes based on clinical and demographic features.  
It combines multiple datasets (Pima Indians, Iraqi, and Bangladeshi populations) to build a predictive model that can generalize across diverse groups.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Final (2).ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with the full ML pipeline (data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation).
- `Pima_diabetes.csv` — Dataset from the Pima Indians Diabetes study.
- `Iraqi_diabetes.csv` — Dataset collected from an Iraqi population.
- `Bengali_diabetes.csv` — Dataset collected from a Bangladeshi population.
